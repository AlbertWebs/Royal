<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Mavic Mini</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>DJI</strong>&nbsp;is a compact drone that offers professional-quality results with no restrictions. Weighing in at under 9 oz, the Mavic Mini’s weight class is both lower and safer than many other drones, which may exempt it from certain regulations (always check local regulations prior to use). This freedom of flight is combined with a stabilized 3-axis gimbal and sophisticated flight modes, which can achieve up to 12MP images, 2.7K Quad HD videos, and complex cinematic shots with just a touch in the DJI Fly app.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the Mavic Mini’s size is that it can stay in the air longer. The Mini drone features up to 30 minutes of flight time on a full battery charge. The included controller is designed to work with select Android and iOS smartphones (contact DJI for compatibility), letting you easily fly the drone while maintaining a low-latency HD video feed from the gimbal from up to 2.5 miles away. To help you get started, DJI includes a flight tutorial in the DJI Fly app, making the Mavic Mini an ideal drone solution for beginners to professionals alike.</p>
